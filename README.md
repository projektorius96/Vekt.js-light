### Development environment

#### **PREREQUISITES**:

1) Make sure you got the latest `Node.js`, as well as the dependency of `Vite.js`;

#### **REMARKS**:

Most of the time you will be coding under the following paths:

- `<root>/implementation/user-config.js`; (used mainly for HTMLCanvas-based grid settings, etc.)
- `<root>/implementation/svg/index.js`; (including the paths below `/svg/`, e.g. `/svg/shapes/`).
