### Development environment

> **PREREQUISITES**:

1) Make sure you got the latest `Node.js` and `npm` on your machine, as well as latest stable version of `Vite.js` installed upon;

> **TROUBLESHOOTING**:

- Windows with WSL2 installed, even if no distro is currently running on the machine, may experience WebSocket-based Hot Module Reload (HMR) disconnection error you will see in your browser's console, hence minimum required `vite.config` that is configured to fall back to HTTP Polling:

```js

    server: {
        watch: {
            usePolling: true,
        }
    }

```

> **DEV REMARKS**:

Most of the time you will be coding under the following paths (_notice, the paths are given in diomatic, Unix-like format_):

- `<root>/implementation/user-config.js`;
- `<root>/implementation/svg/index.js` and relative paths under `/svg/` or below it.
